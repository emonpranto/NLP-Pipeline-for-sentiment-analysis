This repository shows the work flow for NLP Pipeline that how we can demonstrate the steps to make a project from scratch.

## NLP Pipeline Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the workflow for building and deploying an NLP project. The steps include:

- [Feasibility Analysis]: Assessing time, budget, skill set, and domain suitability.
- Data Collection: Gathering relevant data for the project.
Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracting key features from the data.
Model Training: Building and training machine learning models.
Visualization: Analyzing results through visual representations.
Deployment & Maintenance: Deploying the project into production and ensuring ongoing maintenance.
Each step is crucial for creating an effective and reliable NLP system.
