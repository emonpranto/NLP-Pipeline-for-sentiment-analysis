# NLP-Pipeline-for-sentiment-analysis
This repository shows the work flow for NLP Pipeline that how we can demonstrate the steps to make a project from scratch.

## NLP Pipeline Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the workflow for building and deploying an NLP project. The steps include:

- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing time, budget, skill set, and domain suitability.
- Data Collection: Gathering relevant data for the project.
- Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting key features from the data.
- Model Training: Building and training machine learning models.
- Visualization: Analyzing results through visual representations.
- Deployment & Maintenance: Deploying the project into production and ensuring ongoing maintenance.
- Each step is crucial for creating an effective and reliable NLP system.

### Pipeline Workflow

#### Data Collection: 
- Collect YouTube comments using APIs like YouTube Data API.
- Scrape or retrieve Facebook comments using Graph API or third-party tools.
- Gather Google Reviews using Google Places API.

#### Data Preprocessing: 
- Clean data by removing stop words, special characters, emojis, and links.
