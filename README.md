# NLP-Pipeline-for-sentiment-analysis
This repository shows the work flow for NLP Pipeline that how we can demonstrate the steps to make a project from scratch.

## NLP Pipeline Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the workflow for building and deploying an NLP project. The steps include:

- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing time, budget, skill set, and domain suitability.
- Data Collection: Gathering relevant data for the project.
- Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting key features from the data.
- Model Training: Building and training machine learning models.
- Visualization: Analyzing results through visual representations.
- Deployment & Maintenance: Deploying the project into production and ensuring ongoing maintenance.
- Each step is crucial for creating an effective and reliable NLP system.

### Pipeline Workflow

#### Data Collection: 

- Collect YouTube comments using APIs like YouTube Data API.
- Scrape or retrieve Facebook comments using Graph API or third-party tools.
- Gather Google Reviews using Google Places API.

#### Data Preprocessing: 

- Clean data by removing stop words, special characters, emojis, and links.
- Normalize text (lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization)
- Handle missing data and remove duplicates.

#### Feature Engineering:

-Tokenize text and convert it into vectors using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).

#### Model Training:

- To train the model you can use various machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniq, also you can use some pre-trained model like BERT, Transformers to
  build such kind of models.

#### Visualization:

- After making of model you probably should check the model accuracy by using method of F1 score, R2 Score etc and visualize them
  to a graph that people can discove your model accuracy and performance on the perticular data.

#### Deployment:

- Deploy the pipeline on a platform (Streamlit, Flask, or Dockerized service).
- Automate data updates and display results dynamically.
